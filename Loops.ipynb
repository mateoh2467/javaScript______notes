    "__The Purpose of Loops__\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are a fundamental construct in programming used to automate repetitive tasks, thereby making code more efficient and less cluttered. They are particularly useful in various scenarios, such as processing lists or arrays, repeating actions, or handling user inputs. Loops typically utilize an iterator variable, which tracks the state or progress of the loop. This iterator is often integral to the condition that determines when the loop starts and stops. By evaluating this condition, the loop can execute its code block repeatedly until the specified condition is no longer met. \n",
    "\n",
    "Iterator variables can have any name, yet often are represented by the letter `i` or another short letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in loops we often have a condition to change or modify the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops, like most logic in programming can be evaluating to `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Loops\n",
    "***\n",
    "__While Loops__\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"While\" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an __unknown__ number of times, until a certain condition is met. For example, if we want to ask a user for a number between 1 and 10, we don't know how many times the user may enter a large number, so we keep asking \"while the number is not between 1 and 10\". If we (or the computer) knows exactly how many times to execute a section of code (such as shuffling a deck of cards) we use a for loop."
